## General Information
This project is an implementation of an algorithm for drawing Bézier curves using two different approaches: Divide and Conquer and Brute Force.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## How To Run
1. Clone this repository :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KaruniaSyukurBaeha/Tucil2_10023478_10023570.git
```

2. Navigate to the `src` directory:
```shell
cd .\tucil 2\
cd src
python burte_force.py
python divide_and_conquer.py
```
Upon successful execution, a splash screen will appear!


## Programming Language
*Python
